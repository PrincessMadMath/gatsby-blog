The Mai Tai is a cocktail based on rum, Cura√ßao liqueur, orgeat syrup, and lime juice, associated with Polynesian-style settings.

#History

Victor J. Bergeron claimed to have invented the Mai Tai in 1944 at his restaurant, Trader Vic's, in Oakland, California.[1] Trader Vic's forerunner, Donn Beach, claimed to have instead first created it in 1933, although a longtime colleague said that Beach was actually just alledging that the Mai Tai was based on his Q.B. Cooler cocktail.[2][3][4] Don the Beachcomber's recipe is more complex than that of Vic's and some believe tastes quite different.[5][6] Others believe that despite the difference in ingredients that they taste quite similar.[7][8]

The name was allegedly taken from maita'i, the Tahitian word for "good" or "excellence", although the drink is usually spelled as two words, sometimes hyphenated or capitalized.[9][10]
