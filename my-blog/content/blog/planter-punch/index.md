Planter's Punch is an IBA Official Cocktail made of dark rum, several juices, grenadine syrup, sugar syrup, and Angostura bitters.[1]

The cocktail has been said to have originated at the Planters Hotel in Charleston, South Carolina. The September 1878 issue of the London magazine Fun listed the recipe as follows:

<cite>
A wine-glass with lemon juice fill,
Of sugar the same glass fill twice
Then rub them together until
The mixture looks smooth, soft, and nice.

Of rum then three wine glasses add,
And four of cold water please take. A
Drink then you'll have that's not badâ€”
At least, so they say in Jamaica.[2]
